    <h1>Fried Rice</h1>

    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>After our favorite restaurant sadly closed over a decade ago, I spent years tinkering around with dozens and
        dozens of batches of fried rice, attempting to recreate a fried recipe that tasted as good as theirs. And while
        nothing will ever match the original in my book, this fried rice recipe that I’ve landed on is as close as I’ve
        come and has been my favorite go-to ever since. It’s surprisingly speedy to make, easy to customize with your
        favorite add-ins, and SO flavorful and comforting. Thousands of our readers have also made and enjoyed it over
        the years since. So if you’re looking for a good recipe to try, I hope you’ll enjoy it too.</p>
    <p>For shooting this recipe, I used lamb leg cut. After separating the fat and the lean meat, I cut them into small
        cubes (1.5-2 cm/about ½ inch) then mixed them on the skewers.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, whisked</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 small white onion, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked and chilled rice (I prefer short-grain white rice)</li>
        <li>3 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3–4 tablespoons soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons oyster sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Light up charcoal in your grill. While waiting for the flame to subside, thread the lamb onto the skewers.
            Evenly distribute the lean pieces and fatty ones (discard the onion)</li>
        <li>Add an additional 1 tablespoon butter to the pan and heat until melted. Add carrots, onion, peas and garlic,
            and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté for about 5 minutes or until the onion and
            carrots are soft. Increase heat to high, add in the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter, and stir until
            melted. Immediately add the rice, green onions, soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using), and stir until
            combined. Continue sautéing for an additional 3 minutes to fry the rice, stirring occasionally. (I like to
            let the rice rest for a bit between stirs so that it can crisp up on the bottom.) Then add in the eggs and
            stir to combine. Remove from heat, and stir in the sesame oil until combined. Taste and season with extra
            soy sauce, if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 3 days.</li>
    </ol>
